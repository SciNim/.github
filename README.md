# SciNim

SciNim is a loose organization of people from the Nim community who
develop software for scientific purposes.

If you are new to Nim or using Nim for scientific applications, the
[getting-started](https://github.com/SciNim/getting-started)
repository is probably the best starting point. There you also find
the main 'Discussions' tab of the organization.

In case you wish to contribute either just open pull requests or in
case you want to contribute full libraries or programs, just get in
touch. Either via the discussions or contacting any of the existing
members, for example via Matrix or Discord in the Nim #science channel.
